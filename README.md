## Overview

This repository contains all the necessary materials to replicate the research study "Bank Crisis Boosts Bitcoin Price". This includes R scripts, datasets, and graphs.

In this study, we analyze Bitcoin's volatility and compare it to a custom banking index that effectively captures market uncertainty following the Silicon Valley Bank Crisis. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Bitcoin tends to behave similarly to gold during periods of financial instability.
